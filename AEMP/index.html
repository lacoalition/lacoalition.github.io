            This project is a compilation of maps, artifacts and narratives on galleries detailing the ongoing fight against
            artwashing and displacement in Boyle Heights, drawn from the archive of the Boyle Heights Alliance Against Artwashing
            and Displacement. We write this in the middle of the COVID 19 pandemic with 491,000 households bracing to fight against
            potential evictions when LA’s moratoriums expire. The struggle for housing in LA will now face a wave of further
            pressure and speculation by city and private developers — no doubt some will once again use art and gallery space as
            their entry into working class neighborhoods.

                    <br><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you trace the steps of gentrification&mdash;the conversion of a working class
                        community into one designed for and populated by wealthier classes&mdash;you will find a distinct pattern:
                    </span><strong>Developers and real estate speculators have their eyes trained on</strong> <strong>the arrival of artists
                        as the moment to start accumulating property</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A 2007 article in
                    </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives this advice:
                        &ldquo;Want to know where a great place to invest in real estate will be five or 10 years from now? Look at where
                        artists are living now.&rdquo;</span>
                    <br>&nbsp;
                    <br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art is an industry, and the way that it interacts with other industries&mdash;global
                        finance and land use among them&mdash;materially impact our lives. </span><strong>All the progressive intentions in
                        the world cannot stop the blunt mechanisms of urban real-estate speculation.</strong>
                    <br>&nbsp;
                    <br><span style="font-weight: 400;">We made this map because these galleries need to understand their impacts on the
                        history, culture, and community of Boyle Heights. But we also made it for ourselves and our community&mdash;to
                        record our own sense of place, to insist on being heard by cynics who dismiss our drive for survival as unfair or
                        short-sighted, and to fortify ourselves to continue the resistance we have been sustaining for decades.</span>
                    <br>&nbsp;
                    <br><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gallerists targeting Boyle Heights may think their economy is benign, but they
                        are banking on that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">flip of the coin </span></em><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;">that will grow careers and cash out of disinvested warehouses and low-income apartment
                        complexes. Many artists are directly investing in the displacement of their neighbors by moving resources and
                        capital into disinvested spaces.</span><strong>The presence of international art-world capital contributes, on an
                        exponential level, to the displacement of this community.</strong>
                    <br>&nbsp;
                    <br><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if the whole block of galleries&mdash;and then the rest of the
                        neighborhood&mdash;reverted to community control? Our many organized autonomous movements&mdash;like the Union de

                    <br><br /><strong>Gentrification is not an inevitable future. It is not the march of objective progress.</strong><span

                        non-profit developers, land-bankers and gallerists&mdash;to reconsider their collective role in the future of Los

                <br>As BHAAAD&rsquo;s &ldquo;Short History of a Long Struggle&rdquo; explained, the Boyle Heights warehouse district,
                sometimes known as The Flats, has birthed decades of militant neighborhood struggles over jobs, police abuse, gang
                violence, environmental racism, and institutional disinvestment. Before capital fled the Flats, the women in Union de
                Vecinos gave the best years of their lives to fight against bulldozers, institutional neglect, gang violence, and police
                occupation. Their struggle and labor is the reason this neighborhood is now seen as a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; place for
                investment and blue-chip galleries.</br>
                <br>Influenced by the work of Richard Florida in the early 2000s, planners and developers have long deified the role of
                the &ldquo;creative class&rdquo; in urban renewal. Salivating for new money and &ldquo;energy,&rdquo; developers and
                city planners alike have worked to lure upper-middle-class designers, artists, writers, makers, and other
                &ldquo;creatives&rdquo; to under-resourced communities of color by propping up businesses that have nothing to do with
                the needs of that community.</br>
                <br>Dreams of bringing private investment and wealthier residents to the First Street corridor in Boyle Heights have
                tantalized LA officials since at least the early 2000s&mdash;and they&rsquo;ve always implicated the industries of art,
                tech, transportation, academia, and nonprofits.</br>
                <br>The plan to gentrify Boyle Heights was born in a university. In 2009, then-Councilmember Jos&eacute; Huizar
                (arrested in June 2020 for money laundering and corrupt development schemes) recruited 12 graduate students in urban
                planning to explore the feasibility of designating part of the neighborhood as an &ldquo;arts district&rdquo;&mdash;an
                area where &ldquo;arts-related&rdquo; businesses are granted tax exemptions and flexibility in zoning. By 2010, Huizar
                announced multi-million-dollar plans to attract art galleries to the area. In 2011, LA City Council created and funded a
                task force to develop the district.</br>
                <br>As more of the creative class opened up shop in Boyle Heights, the national elite began to take note and glorify
                their presence as bringing light to an uncultured, desolate wasteland. &ldquo;Within a few minutes&rsquo; drive of one
                another, the galleries are beginning to give the area the urban cultural density that Los Angeles mostly lacks,&rdquo;
                the New York Times proclaimed in 2015.</br>
                <br>But public art and creativity have always thrived in Boyle Heights. It simply hasn&rsquo;t been heavily capitalized.
                The city exploited the community&rsquo;s organic traditions, claiming that its task force would uplift &ldquo;an arts
                movement based in the neighborhood's rich history of ethnic diversity, rich culture and art&rdquo;&mdash;yet at the same
                time, actively fought to quash that artistic expression so that they could replace it with art as commodity, art as
                money, art as capitalism.</br>
                <br>Until the task force was established, the city had banned all mural painting in Boyle Heights. Street art and
                graffiti were criminalized and whitewashed. But when, in 2013, the city saw an opportunity to use art to attract wealth
                and prestige, they hired institutional artists to enact their own public mural program&mdash;a utility box painting
                project, funded through a $10 million grant from LA Metro and strategically placed to brighten up their new rail line.
                &ldquo;We&rsquo;re encouraging more murals; it&rsquo;s going to be a great arts district once we&rsquo;re done,&rdquo;
                Huizar bragged.</br>
                <br>The opening of LA Metro&rsquo;s Gold Line stations were part and parcel of the effort to drive white money into
                Boyle Heights. As early as 2003, then-Councilmember Antonio Villaraigosa said the Gold Line would &ldquo;be an engine
                for economic development and lead to the revitalization of First Street.&rdquo; Huizar later called it the
                &ldquo;catalyst&rdquo; for the &ldquo;artsy coffee shops and small bars opening up.&rdquo; His spokesperson Rick Coca
                further clarified that rail and bike lanes were installed in Boyle Heights not in response to a demonstrated community
                need, but to serve &ldquo;visitors to the 1st Street Arts District.&rdquo;</br>
                <br>One autonomous community center adjacent to the so-called &ldquo;1st Street Arts District&rdquo; where art galleries
                began transplanting to was La Conxa. This space has always been run as an autonomous community center and a brave space,
                also serving as headquarters for the OVAS (formerly Ovarian Psycos). The OVAS, their members, and community aligned
                organizations hosted various forms of programming that centered community members of different ages professions, and
                backgrounds. Their events, actions, and activities reflected a commitment to resistance to capitalism and patriarchy
                while also building community strength and unity in Boyle Heights.Their energy, contributions, and vision were the exact
                opposite of what many art galleries would bring to the neighborhood.</br>
                <br>In August 2016, Vera Campbell&rsquo;s company, Boyle Heights Properties LLC., who also owned other arts-related
                properties in the area including 356 Mission art gallery, bought the property at which La Conxa was located for
                $1,700,000. In October 2016, Campbell significantly raised the rent at La Conxa to around $1,500 per month. Campbell had
                plans to demolish the 1214 E. 1st St. property and turn it into a gallery space. It has been mostly unoccupied and
                unused since the OVAS were displaced, but recently some have seen private events taking place there. A single family
                home in the rear half of the property has remained empty, too, since a family there was displaced in 2016.</br>
                <br>The struggle against different art gallery owners is just one story of how Boyle Heights residents led their fight
                directly to those doing the harm in the community. As these different galleries have proven, they are themselves a large
                puzzle piece in the wave of real estate speculation and commodification that is attempting to gentrify Boyle Heights
                neighborhoods. This process of gentrification in Boyle Heights involves the racial banishment of long-time residents by
                attracting real estate speculators to use the existence of art galleries, tech spaces and media spaces to attract
                high-income &amp; wealthy property owners. Art gallerists and other gentrifying figures do not offer any resources to
                contribute to the self-determination of existing residents nor do they offer any tangible support to local neighbors. A
                laundromat, a day care center, a local corner market - all of these establishments are more affordable and serve a
                greater purpose than exist as an art gallery.</br>
                <br>Today, the fight continues against new and remaining gentrifiers that move into the warehouse district of Boyle
                Heights, but also against the landlords and LAPD in Boyle Heights. and entities that seek to undermine organized
                community networks of support as we see in local autonomous spaces and tenant union associations. Local residents and
                their organizing efforts continue to fight the next wave of gentrification with invaluable takeaways and distinct
                experiences in fighting back against wealthy gentrifiers, regardless of the form it may take to sell or buy the Boyle
                Heights community. </br>

    <p style="color:black">
        This map shows the arts businesses that have capitalized on the city’s strategic gentrification planning and funding
        initiatives to remake Boyle Heights in their image. Some of these businesses were still operating when COVID-19 began,
        selling vanity goods that are utterly mismatched to the buying power and material needs of the long-neglected
        neighborhood. But in other cases, community resistance—demonstrations, boycotts, public education, and yes, truly public
        art—successfully shut gentrifying businesses down, marking the first steps in reclaiming their space for the people.
        These tactics work. Still, we must also be wary of the potential for businesses to leave one area only to find another
        to exploit. Whether it’s Chinatown or West Adams, one community’s victory cannot be the catalyst for another’s
        destruction.
