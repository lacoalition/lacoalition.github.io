            Every day, at least three families are pushed out of Boyle Heights. The presence
            of international art-world capital contributes, on an exponential level, to the
            displacement of this community. Many artists are directly investing in the
            displacement of their neighbors by moving resources and capital into disinvested
            spaces, and widely publicizing the virtues of the "transformation,"
            "pioneering," or "revitalization" they are leading. They are banking on that
            Flip of the Coin that will grow careers and cash from the flipping of
            disinvested warehouses and low-income apartment complexes. They are speculating
            on the likelihood of gentrification-the likelihood that <b>a customer
            base able to pay top dollar will
            replace the poor</b> as the inevitable return on their financial investments.

            We made this map because these galleries need to understand their impacts on the
            history, culture, and community of Boyle Heights, but we also made it for
            ourselves and our community-to record our own sense of place, to insist on being
            heard by <span style="text-decoration:underline;">x who dismiss our drive for
            survival as unfair or short-sighted, </span>and to fortify ourselves to continue
            the resistance we have been sustaining for decades.
        </p>
        <p>
            Boyle Heights is full of organized autonomous movements-not only the Defend
            Boyle Heights crews, Union de Vecinos, and the Eastside L.A. Tenants' Union, but
            also the Street Vendors, the Mariachis, the Ovarian Psycos-cycles, the Immigrant
            Youth Coalition, and the Day Laborers who have all organized autonomously and
            who stand in solidarity with our call for community self-determination of land
            and space in the neighborhood.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Boyle Heights <span style="text-decoration:underline;">warehouse district</span> 
            (the post-industrial neighborhood sometimes known as "The Flats") has seen decades 
            of militant neighborhood struggles over jobs, police
            abuse and gang violence, environmental racism and institutional disinvestment.
            The families in Union de Vecinos have marched in this area for years seeking
            peace and justice for their neighborhood. Before capital fled the flats, the
            women in Union de Vecinos gave the best years of their lives to fight against
            bulldozers, institutional neglect, gang violence, and police occupation. They
            saved their homes against all odds, they fought for better education for their
            children, they created safer streets, and they started one of the first copwatch
            programs to defend their children against racist policing. Their struggle and
            their labor is the reason that this neighborhood is now seen as a "safe" place
            for investment and blue chip galleries today.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, we find ourselves again in an historic moment for forging forms of urban
            resistance and transformative justice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gentrification is never inevitable. It is the result of actions and policies
            that can be changed through collective direct action. We challenge everyone, but
            especially non-profit developers, land-bankers and gallerists to reconsider
            their collective role in the future of Los Angeles.
