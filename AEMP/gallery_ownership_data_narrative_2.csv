356 Mission / Ooga Booga,"356 S Mission Road, Los Angeles, CA 90033",Laura Owens / Gavin Brown / Wendy Yao,BOYLE HEIGHTS PROPERTIES LLC,1500000,12177,11973,1081841,582527,1664368,34.04298,-118.227011,"Laura Owens is a painter based in Los Angeles, represented by the New York-based blue-chip gallery Gavin Brown’s enterprise. In 2013 she turned her 12,000-square-foot studio in Boyle Heights into the gallery 356 Mission, bankrolled by Gavin Brown. Brown supports Laura Owens by renting 356 Mission from Vera Campbell, who is responsible for major artwashing developments across Los Angeles. // Laura Owens and multi-millionaire art dealer Gavin Brown leased 356 S. Mission Road in 2012 from clothing manufacturer and real estate mogul Vera Campbell and Boyle Heights Properties, LLC. (from 365 mission closing)","Many have called 365 a “pioneer” of artist-run spaces in Boyle Heights. Since Owens’ arrival, wealthy galleries from Maccarone to Venus over Manhattan have followed in her footsteps and have expanded their empires into the West Coast into our hood. Owens’s career has also benefited greatly due to her relationship with this space. In 2014 her drawings and paintings sold for between $15,000 and $175,000. Laura Owens and Gavin Brown have the financial means to be ANYWHERE in Los Angeles, in New York, and around the world. However, they choose to take advantage of low-income POC communities like Boyle Heights, Chinatown, and Harlem to build their own enterprises.","More than a year ago, Defend Boyle Heights and the Boyle Heights Alliance Against Artwashing and Displacement launched a boycott against all galleries in Boyle Heights and organized a series of public actions against the growing number of galleries in Boyle Heights, including 356 Mission. In July 2016, at the courtyard of Pico Aliso Public Housing, multiple generations of Boyle Heights residents spoke face to face to the staff of the galleries, including Ethan Swan, the manager of 356 Mission, asking them to leave. An official picket line was drawn in February 2017 during the offensive neoliberal Artist’s Political Action Network meeting, which was established by the Los Angeles art world élite.","On May 24, 2017, a smaller delegation met with 356 Mission and made a plan to meet 2 weeks later to discuss how and when 356 Mission would leave Boyle Heights. Laura Owens postponed the scheduled follow-up meeting due to a family emergency. The community waited patiently for her to return with her promise. We never heard from her. 356 Mission continues to ignore the community’s demand to leave and continues their programming. Despite this, the community has also succeeded in shutting down multiple programs at the gallery, from Ruth Root’s exhibition opening to Chris Kraus’s book launch. In April 2018 gallery left.",365.png

The event was supposed to be a community meeting to discuss the role artists play in gentrification in Los Angeles, and particularly in Boyle Heights. However, since the beginning of the meeting, thanks to our supporters in the audience who sent us pictures, videos and notes on what SHG staff were saying, the community dialogue was already painting the artist and therefore the galleries free of culpability.","At approximately 4 P.M., DBH led a group of 30-to-40 people, which included several long-time residents of the community and members of Union de Vecinos, Ovarian Psycos, Serve the People – Los Angeles, East Los Angeles Brown Berets and the Backyard Brigade, into the SHG building. We flanked both sides of the stage where SHG staff were addressing a crowd of approximately 45 people. We chanted “El barrio no se vende! Boyle Heights se defiende!” as we held signs denouncing gentrification and in particular the role that SHG and others have played in being complicit with gentrification. One of our members took the mic from an SHG staff person and a couple of residents from the Pico Gardens Projects denounced the art galleries moving into the neighborhood irrespective of the rent-increases, evictions and overall redevelopment that accompany them. They spoke about the community’s need for actual authentic affordable housing and sustainable jobs, and that the community doesn’t need any more art galleries, especially ones who refuse to work with the community prior to moving in (which all art galleries close to the Sixth Street Bridge are guilty of). We read our demands, which state that all new art galleries must immediately leave Boyle Heights and that those buildings should be utilized by our community members the ways we best see fit, which may be converting them into emergency housing, shelters or centers for job training. As we left the building, we chanted “We don’t need more galleries; We need higher salaries!” That is to say, Boyle Heights is a low-income renter community. Get the fuck outta here with that argument that we need more art galleries. Boyle Heights has always been a cultural and artistic icon, with or without galleries. That is not a genuine and immediate need of the vast majority of community members.","A Conflict of Interest: Felicia “Fe” Montes and the Displacement of Wyvernwood Residents, Renewal of the 6th Street Viaduct Felicia “Fe” Montes is the fiance of Joel Garcia, director of programs and operations at Self-Help Graphics & Art. Felicia Montes is on the payroll of Urban Strategies as the director of community relations, the public relations firm that was hired by the Miami-based private investment firm, 15 Group, and more recently the developers of the 6th street bridge, to create a more inviting atmosphere for redevelopment, specifically in the proposed demolition of the Wyvernwood apartments.","Self Help Graphics & Art’s Board of Directors and leadership will be held to task and subjected to the utmost scrutiny due to their position in the community as leaders and their vested interests in gentrification projects. Rudy Espinoza, Interim Executive Director of Self Help Graphics and current Executive Director at Leadership for Urban Renewal Network (LURN) and Board of Director and Alfred Fraijo Jr. have both openly expressed support for redevelopment and “urban renewal” in a community fighting gentrification. Self Help Graphics Has Never, to Our Knowledge, Publicly Acknowledged Its Direct Displacement of Local Jobs And although SHG has been in the Eastside community for 40 years, it only recently relocated to Boyle Heights in 2011 where it displaced a fish factory where residents of the immediate working class community were employed. SHG also has a unique position of being located in a heated community battle zone against gentrification given the fastly developing “ Arts District” across the river which poses a direct threat to Boyle Heights. SHG leadership must be self critical of their role in the current political landscape as well as provide authentically open communication and support to community movements fighting gentrification. We call for a moratorium on SHG’s work with outside artists and galleries that pose a threat of gentrification by any means. Unfortunately, SHG has more than once chosen the side of redevelopment, prioritizing art and artists over people’s livelihoods, as hopefully made clear in this statement.",
