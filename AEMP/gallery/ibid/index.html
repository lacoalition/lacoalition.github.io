                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swedish gallerist Magnus Edensvard began his crusade to gentrify poor communities 10
                        years before he came to Los Angeles. In 2004, he opened his first gallery in what </span><a
                        href="http://www.arterritory.com/print.php?lang=en&amp;id=788"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art
                            Territory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then called &ldquo;the once very cheap&mdash;but now
                        very gentrified, and therefore no longer quite exciting&mdash;Hoxton Square&rdquo; in east London.
                        Edensvard&rsquo;s outlook and approach to opening up a gallery was rooted in a racist mindset where wealthy
                        artists could take advantage of properties for sale in disinvested neighborhoods and also contribute to the
                        phenomenon of objectifying working class communities.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014 &mdash; Edensvard turned his sights on Los Angeles. He opened the Ibid
                        Project in a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">warehouse in South Santa Fe in the Arts District and began
                        touting Los Angeles as a paradise for art investors and real estate speculators. In an interview with </span><a
                        href="https://www.artspace.com/magazine/interviews_features/the-nada-network/ibid-magnus-edensvard-interview-54276"><em><span
                                style="font-weight: 400;">Art Space</span></em></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he called himself
                        &ldquo;an involuntary ambassador for the DTLA property scene&rdquo;. By 2015, his efforts had succeeded perhaps
                        too well: His own gallery received a 30-day notice to vacate.But Edensvard, unlike thousands of L.A. tenants
                        facing eviction from their homes, especially in an ongoing pandemic, was able to negotiate with his landlord
                        (not incidentally, a Beverly Hills-based investment firm focused on &ldquo;emerging neighorboods&rdquo;&mdash;
                        or, gentrifying communities) for more time at the Arts District space.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, Ibid relocated across the river in Boyle Heights, taking up a space
                    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">designed by Kulapat Yantrasat of trendy architecture firm wHY.&nbsp;</span>
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBID Gallery shared their art gallery warehouse space with another million-dollar
                        gallery operation, UTA Artist Space. Members of BHAAAD and Defend Boyle Heights and Pico Gardens residents
                        protested their galleries on a Saturday in July 2017 only to have the IBID Gallery staff call LAPD officers to
                        their location in order to intimidate neighbors, residents, and community organizers. IBID Gallery, much like
                        MaRS and Chimento and many more galleries, are easily frightened by women and people of color from Boyle Heights
                        and disregarded the community&rsquo;s safety by inviting trigger-happy law enforcement to a non-violent picket
                        line.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the summer of 2018, IBID Gallery closed its doors in Boyle Heights and instead
                        returned to the comfort of a wealthier and whiter neighborhood in West Hollywood. </span></p>
