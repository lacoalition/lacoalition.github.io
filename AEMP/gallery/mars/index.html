            <div class="center-text">
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Museum as Retail Space (MaRS) was operated by </span><strong>Robert Zin
                        Stark</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of a building his mother purchased on his behalf for
                        $700,000. Stark himself lives in a million-dollar condo loft in the Downtown Arts District.)</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MaRS is located in a part of Boyle Heights near the LA River where longstanding
                        public housing abuts industrial businesses and factories. At the gallery&rsquo;s opening, art collectors gazed
                        at $10,000 paintings while working-class residents were struggling to afford rent increases not far from the
                        gallery&rsquo;s location. Buyers took $50 Uber rides to visit the luxury art outpost in an area with a median
                        household income is $21,700. It was a clear image of income inequality and what gentrifiers really value
                        (capital) in Los Angeles. Who could seriously argue that spaces like this benefit poor communities? No local
                        street vendors or long-time community members were likely to frequent MaRS. A real community benefit would be
                        laundromats, childcare centers, and additional services of the like. The community decided to amplify their
                        dislike and anger.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BHAAAD and other local organizers initiated picket lines outside MaRS in May 2017.
                        These actions became a popular and effective tool to dissuade would-be patrons from breaking the boycott against
                        gentrifying spaces in Boyle Heights. More than once</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Stark attempted to
                        co-opt protests by claiming he was sympathet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ic to community needs. Other
                        times, he took a more dangerous approach by calling the LAPD to harass protestors. </span><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;">When</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> poor people of color are subject to
                        state-sanctioned violence, the fact that this wealthy white gentrifier chose to call the cops&mdash;because we
                        had a simple picket line&mdash;illustrates how little he cares for Boyle Heights residents and their
                        safety.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MaRS closed down in May 2018 after strong criticism and organizing. </span><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;">Stark claimed to understand what he did wrong by opening a gallery in Boyle Heights,
                        and even </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">met with members of various anti-gentrification groups to
                        address how he could be held accountable and remedy some impacts of his actions. But as of today, he has dropped
                        any effort to convert the space for community needs and has opted to turn the former gallery space into a
                        cannabis production/manufacturing shop.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, additional galleries, as well as tech spaces and coffee shops, surround what
                        is left of MaRS&rsquo;s physical space. Their quick proliferation demonstrates how art spaces catering to the
                        upper echelons of society attract other businesses designed to those with higher incomes.</span></p>
