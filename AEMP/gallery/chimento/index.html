                <p><strong>Eva Chimento</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opened her Chimento Contemporary in 2015, leasing a
                        studio space inside a large warehouse made up of different studio and residential spaces on Anderson Street in
                        Boyle Heights. Despite her claims of being inclusive, Eva Chimento failed to create a space that served local
                        residents.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the summer of 2016, Chimento attended a community call-in event with various
                        organizations and other gallerists. Instead of listening to residents who were ready to explain how her gallery
                        and others like it were impacting their lives, Chimento lashed out with self-righteous resentment about the use
                        of the word &ldquo;gentrifier.&rdquo; At this 2016 community gathering at the Pico Gardens public housing site,
                        she gave a paternalistic speech claiming that the community did not know how to spot actual enemies of
                        gentrification. Also, by citing her one-time art workshop with youth of color, she asserted that her minimal
                        contribution granted her unlimited access to do what she wanted in this gentrifying and exploited
                        neighborhood.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August 2018, after several call-outs and campaigns demanding galleries leave,
                        Chimento announced that she was relocating her gallery and subleasing her space in Boyle Heights. At that time,
                        she made a haphazard effort at offering her space to Defend Boyle Heights. She offered the coalition the
                        remaining months on her lease, but indicated she would charge the community the full rent to occupy her space.
                        The community rebuked her offer when they saw it merely as a means to only appear in solidarity while still
                        getting paid for the space she was leasing as a gentrifier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after, Chimento Contemporary relocated to </span><strong>West
                        Adams</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;a historically Black neighborhood also
                        gentrifying&mdash;and was met with another demonstration against her business. During the rally, a gallery
                        attendant called the police and the FBI on protesters and residents. Similar to other gallerists and
                        gentrifiers, she had no concern for what police are capable of doing to community residents and her gentry
                        entitlement put protesters directly at risk of authoritarian violence.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Boyle Heights warehouse that used to house Chimento Contemporary continues
                        to rent to high-priced hipster spaces, including a media studio and a coffee shop</span></p>
