                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Franklin Parrasch has been dealing art since 1986. Having run six galleries in New
                        York, Parrasch now has a gallery on the tony Upper East Side, a block away from Central Park. </span><a

                            style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, following the call of
                        the art market to &ldquo;go west,&rdquo; he partnered with </span><strong>Christopher Heijnen</strong><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;"> to open a gallery in Boyle Heights on Boyle Avenue in a formerly industrial area. The
                        program was purportedly guided by a &ldquo;conscious reflection upon the process of creativity as related to
                        human evolution,&rdquo; while ignoring the human conditions of housing, artwashing, and gentrification that
                        affect the neighborhood.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their 5,000 sq. ft. space used to be the site of a dinette and lunchroom for former
                        Sears employees, who likely lived in and around Boyle Heights. The gallery space is now owned by Wallingford
                        Investors Limited, based in Beverly Hills. The gallery&rsquo;s proximity to the vacant Sears building is no
                        doubt an intentional move by Parrash and Heijnen to situate themselves next to what will become creative office
                        spaces for hipsters, techies, and gentrifiers with no intention of contributing to the existing community. The
                        Sears building was once a workplace for many Boyle Heights, East LA, and Southeast LA residents. It is now owned
                        by luxury real estate developer (</span><a

                        style="font-weight: 400;">. This real estate developer has built out work havens and high-end apartments for
                        gentrifiers in different parts of Los Angeles, including the gentrifying and vulnerable landscapes of </span><a

                            style="font-weight: 400;">video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of what he wants the Sears
                        building to become soo. Artists and gallerists, like Parrasch and Heijnen, will certainly embrace this type of
                        pretentious and ostentatious luxury real estate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parrasch and Heijnen knew exactly what they were doing when they moved to the
                        Boyle Avenue warehouse and are likely cheering on the luxury development planned by multimillionaires like
                        Shomof. It is not a coincidence that it&rsquo;s also right next to the </span><a

                            River</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is being touted by real estate agents who see its
                        slick expansion as a selling point. More galleries will likely be enticed to open in this industrial part of
                        Boyle Heights once the Sears building is redeveloped, and this </span><a
                        href="https://boyleheightsbeat.com/plans-for-historic-sears-tower-spark-gentrification-debate-video/"><span
                            style="font-weight: 400;">will threaten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the long-time tenure of
                        working-class families nearby in Wyvernwood and Estrada Courts, as well as houseless residents along the local
                        streets in this area. The presence of Parrasch Heijnen Gallery remains an open invitation to other real estate
                        developers and gentrifiers to displace our neighbors and long-time businesses. </span></p>
