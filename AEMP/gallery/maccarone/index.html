                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A veteran gentrifier, </span><strong>Michelle Maccarone</strong><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;"> opened her first New York art gallery on the border between Chinatown and the Lower
                        East Side in 2001. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;At this time, these working-class neighborhoods
                        were beginning to experience the effects of artwashing and gentrification. </span><span

                        building on Canal Street in Chinatown, back when nobody had galleries down there.&rdquo; According to
                    </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ldquo;The gallery
                        quickly gained a reputation for being &lsquo;edgy&rsquo; and &lsquo;notorious&rsquo; and all those words you use
                        to describe great, exciting stuff that you don&rsquo;t get to see in a typical white cube in Chelsea.&rdquo; As
                        a member of the aspiring elite, this tactic of making use of working-class culture for social and literal
                        capital, and its impacts on the lives of its neighbors&mdash;eviction and displacement&mdash;are minor concerns.
                        &ldquo;I was the first asshole who opened on the Lower East Side,&rdquo; Maccarone jokes in her </span><em><span

                            Times</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published a lengthy article on Macarone&rsquo;s new space
                        in Los Angeles: </span><a

                        quality&mdash;I kind of like that. I like that we spent a fortune on security.&rdquo; This article is pivotal in
                        a couple ways, the person writing it is oblivious to the geography of LA, conflating Downtown LA, Boyle Heights,
                        and the Arts District. The article puts forward an idea that there is a large open frontier of abandoned
                        property in this amorphous downtown area just waiting to be developed. This jumped out to locals as totally off
                        the mark. In many ways, Boyle Heights is spatially dense, and the area the </span><em><span

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September 2015, Maccarone opened its giant 50,000 sq. ft. location in a renovated
                        warehouse down the street from 356 Mission in Boyle Heights. Maccarone rents her luxurious Boyle Heights space
                        and has a 15-year lease. She borrowed the money for a renovation of the LA space against the value of her West
                        Village gallery. According to a </span><a

                        September 2019, Maccarone is currently in financial trouble after being sued by two artists she failed to pay.
                        Having moved from Chinatown in New York to Greenwich Village, Maccarone followed in the footsteps of many other
                        New York galleries that opened second locations in Los Angeles. In the article </span><em><span

                        describes how she got the idea for the location of her space from Laura Owens&rsquo;s 356 Mission</span><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;itself a joint venture with Gavin Brown. Brown and Maccarone&rsquo;s New York
                        galleries were across the street from one another (although Brown has since moved on to Harlem). For decades,
                        these galleries have moved from one working-class POC neighborhood to another in New York; to them, Boyle
                        Heights is just a fresh vein of edginess and &ldquo;danger&rdquo; to mine for social capital.</span></p>
