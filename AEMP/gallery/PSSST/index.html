                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014, two former </span><strong>CalArts</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">
                        students, </span><strong>Jules Gimbrone</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong>Barnett
                        Cohen</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, launched PSSST in a former industrial space only a few blocks
                        from the Pico Aliso housing project. The galleries popping up around the neighborhood were just starting to
                        garner national and international attention. With the planned renovation of the Sixth Street Bridge and rumors
                        that the city would take that opportunity to expand the Arts District across the river, residents of Boyle
                        Heights&mdash;some of whom had already been fighting to protect their homes for over 30 years&mdash;and members
                        of the housing justice, queer, and arts communities were alarmed.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <img alt="Bye to PSSST" src="../../img/media/bye2pst_CredittoBHAAAD.jpg">
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some investigation revealed that the building had recently been purchased by an
                    </span><strong>undisclosed investor</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who dropped over a million dollars
                        into the procurement and renovation of the former warehouse. Included in the agreement, as described by PSSST
                        founders (at an initial forum held at the gallery about the contested space), this arrangement was allowing the
                        gallery to use the space for four years. This seemed to suggest that whoever purchased the building intended to
                        use those four years as a bridge to grow their property value, using the cachet and draw that arts venues
                        generate, anticipating the arrival of a new &ldquo;arts district&rdquo; and the increasing property values sure
                        to follow. Many of those involved in opposing PSSST had enough life and organizing experience to recognize its
                        arrival as a form of public relations that did nothing to alter the structural realities the gallery would be
                        setting in motion.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <img alt="Cops at PSSST" src="./img/cops_PSSST.jpg">
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of those structural realities began before the gallery opened, as the gallery
                        garnered enthusiastic press in the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></em><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;">, now archived under the headline &ldquo;</span><a
                        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/arts/design/boyle-heights-gallery-scene-in-los-angeles-is-still-growing.html"><span

                        style="font-weight: 400;">.&rdquo; This uncritical style of reporting new, highly elite enterprises, without
                        examining any counternarrative, repeats itself as a method of hyping real estate investment, rather than being
                        any type of journalism. PSSST&rsquo;s mission was sold to the Art &amp; Design section readership as a kind of
                        social justice project steeped in identity politics, inviting QTPOC artists to show their work to an art world
                        audience down the block from some of the only remaining public housing in Los Angeles. Long-standing residents
                        who had fought for decades to improve living conditions in the neighborhood were not fooled.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community meetings were held at Union de Vecinos, and at PSSST as well, and questions
                        were posed to the two co-founders, with no transparency gained. Resistance to the opening of PSSST continued
                        because of this lack of transparency and unwillingness on the part of the co-founders to be accountable to the
                        deep contradictions between the language used to promote the space, and the actual impact that such a space can
                        have on the housing market and on the life of a low-income community already facing the rising pressures of
                        evictions, development and the Los Angeles housing market.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            style="font-weight: 400;">community meeting in the Pico Aliso Houses</span></a><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;"> convened by BHAAAD and Defend Boyle Heights, </span><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;">PSSST was seen clearly by the community for what it was: an investment vehicle, which
                        should be seen only secondarily as a &ldquo;Cultural Institution.&rdquo; Further, the branding of the building
                        as a cultural institution seemed </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">to be </span></em><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;">the investment strategy. This convergence of a social-justice window dressing and
                        cultural-space-as-investment-strategy galvanized a coalition of Boyle Heights residents and activists from many
                        neighborhoods to launch a campaign demanding the gallery abandon its mission. This public campaign of education,
                        organizing, and action insisted that the primary effects of this space, regardless of artistic programming,
                        could not be separated from its structural impact as an investment property and would only serve to drive up
                        property values and directly contribute to raising hype, investment, and rents in the surrounding residential
                        neighborhoods. In many ways, the successful organizing against PSSST was the beginning of a new,
                        intergenerational, militant approach to resisting artwashing.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, one of the founders also worked as a real estate agent for Clint Lukens
                        Realty, revealing the connection between art development and the real estate market at the heart of the project.
                        Further, the gallery used the language of social justice to rationalize their space as something benevolent, not
                        deleterious to the residents. The gallery closed its doors in February 2017.</span></p>
