                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicodim is one of those galleries seeking to capitalize on Boyle Heights proximity to
                        the hip and trendy Arts District while claiming the edginess and street cred of a poor,
                        &ldquo;undiscovered&rdquo; neighborhood. Owner </span><strong>Mihai Nicodim</strong><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;"> has relied on his rags-to-riches story, claiming &ldquo;I was poor once, too&rdquo;
                        in order to paint an image of himself as a hard-working immigrant who is just trying to sell art to survive. In
                        reality, Nicodim is a high-profile art dealer whose 10,000 sq. ft. gallery represents 19 international artists,
                        yielding major profits.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The neighborhood&rsquo;s frustration reached a boiling point when someone tagged
                        &ldquo;FUCK WHITE ART&rdquo; on the gallery&rsquo;s doors. Nicodim called the police immediately, bringing the
                        threat of state violence to a community already under constant surveillance. The police threatened to launch an
                        FBI hate crime investigation against the hood&mdash;weaponizing a law supposedly designed to protect vulnerable
                        communities.</span></p>

                        November 5, 2016. White accomplices in the movement spoke about the statement inherent in &ldquo;FUCK WHITE

                        style="font-weight: 400;">. People moved out of her way just in time to avoid being injured, but were shocked by
                        this act of brutality that could have seriously injured elderly residents and other community members. Her
                        complete lack of regard for our demands and our safety inspired us to use our anger to push her as much as
                        possible to leave the neighborhood.</span></p>
