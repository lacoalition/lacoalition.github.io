                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This art gallery opened in the Arts District before moving to Boyle Heights in 2016.
                        Today, it is situated alongside similarly trendy galleries like Maccarone. (Its former space west of the L.A.
                        River is now occupied by an upscale fashion boutique business.) Little Big Man counts several global
                        corporations, such as Levi&rsquo;s and Calvin Klein, among its clients&mdash;a roster that hints at its
                        financial aspirations and illustrates just how far it is from being a valuable institution to the residents of
                        Boyle Heights.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The owner of Little Big Man&rsquo;s warehouse space, </span><strong>Nathan
                        Korman</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has been active in the real estate scene in Los Angeles for a
                        long time in different parts of the city such as </span><a

                            style="font-weight: 400;">Hollywood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a

                            style="font-weight: 400;">Downtown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He&rsquo;s also been active
                        in developing or flipping buildings in gentrifying neighborhoods across the city&mdash;and then not maintaining
                        them in uninhabitable conditions, earning the title of a </span><a

                            style="font-weight: 400;">slumlord</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This building alone boasts

                            style="font-weight: 400;">citations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that shows how irresponsible
                        and neglectful Korman is of his commercial tenants&mdash;even when they&rsquo;re white, upwardly-mobile
                        hipsters.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <img alt="Little Big Man Gallery Ownder Nathan Korman is a Slum Lord" src="../../img/media/LBM_NathanKormanIsASlumLord.jpg">
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another component of Korman&rsquo;s business model&mdash;one that is intrinsic to all
                        gentrification endeavors, public or private&mdash;is incentivizing the production of more real estate investment
                        and development designed to serve the same clientele on whose presence Little Big Man Gallery relies. It is not
                        a coincidence that Korman rents his space, once built, to hip, overpriced businesses in hopes of attracting more
                        and more gentry to Boyle Heights.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor is it a coincidence that, just down the street from Korman&rsquo;s perverse
                        operation, millionaire real estate developer </span><strong>Mark Borman</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">
                        plans to flip another former manufacturing plant into </span><strong>Bridge &amp; Corner</strong><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;">, an upscale &ldquo;creative&rdquo; office space. It is not hyperbole to say that
                        Borman makes displacement and dispossession his business; his investment vehicle The Borman Group </span><a
                        href="https://www.thebormangroup.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">promises</span></a><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;"> to &ldquo;consistently deliver space that meets the needs of a sophisticated creative
                        user&rdquo; (read: </span><a href="https://www.thebormangroup.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his
                            firm&rsquo;s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) as well as &ldquo;the financial returns of
                        an equally sophisticated investor&rdquo; (read: a predatory speculator with free-flowing capital to spare) by
                        specializing in &ldquo;transformative markets early in the process&rdquo; (of&mdash;what
                        else?&mdash;gentrification.)</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Borman&rsquo;s plans to bring the wealthy and white to the area recently made him
                        infamous to renters throughout the city when he tried&mdash;and failed&mdash;to </span><a
                        href="https://medium.com/@LATenantsUnion/the-tenant-6-9db48946f7e3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evict a
                            family from their home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the street from Bridge &amp;
                        Corner, where he planned to install an office parking lot (yes, really.) Because the family&rsquo;s home was one
                        of the rapidly dwindling numbers of rent-controlled buildings in Los Angeles, Borman relied on a con familiar to
                        all those determined to displace: the </span><strong>Ellis Act. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">After
                        an extensive grassroots defense campaign by the </span><strong>Los Angeles Tenants Union</strong><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;">, a court denied Borman&rsquo;s petition and left the family in place&mdash;for now.
                        Word is, after licking his wounds, Borman is already preparing to re-file the eviction and double down on his
                        plans to profit on the vulnerability of the Boyle Heights community.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Little Big Man, meanwhile, still operates in Boyle Heights thanks to their commercial
                        landlord and the nearby commercial landlords that, together, seek to morph this area of Boyle Heights into an
                        expensive extension of the Arts District.</span></p>
