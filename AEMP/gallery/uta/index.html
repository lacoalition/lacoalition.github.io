                        Talent Agency</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;was conceived of a gross combination of movie
                        industry riches and stark real estate speculation. It serves some of the most </span><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;">well known and well off celebrities in the world</span><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;"> who are looking to extend their influence in the fine art world&mdash;such as
                        &ldquo;opportunities&rdquo; to open new galleries. </span><strong>Joel Lubin</strong><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;">, a media agent for wealthy Hollywood elites, became a board member for the Institute
                        for Contemporary Arts, Los Angeles (ICA LA). The UTA executives could have easily leased gallery spaces on
                        Melrose Avenue or in Beverly Hills, but chose to fuel the predatory arts-as-investment scene taking over Boyle
                        Heights.</span></p>

                        people&rsquo;s eviction notice by Union de Vecinos members and the Boyle Heights community. Angry residents
                        demanded the firm leave the neighborhood immediately as it did not provide needed services or bring any benefit
                        to the community. (Adding insult to injury, the opening exhibition romanticized the decades of violence and pain
                        Boyle Heights endured during the War on Drugs with </span><strong>Larry Clark</strong><span
