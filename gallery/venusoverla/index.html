                        and New York blue-chip gallerist </span><strong>Adam Lindemann</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For a
                        sense of Lindemann&rsquo;s background, some family history is in order: His father is George Lindemann, a
                        billionaire oil company executive and a donor to Republican extremists like Michele Bachmann and Newt Gingrich.

                        gentrifying non-profits that masquerade as &ldquo;innovators&rdquo; in so-called affordable housing. In reality,
                        these organizations&mdash;including ELACC, LURN, and From Lot to Spot&mdash;collaborate with state agencies and
                        government officials who aid or turn a blind eye to the displacement of low-income tenants (corrupt
                        Councilmember Jos&eacute; Huizar, Mayor Eric Garcetti, and LA Metro, to name a few.)&nbsp;</span></p>

                        several galleries, including Venus Over Los Angeles. Gallery-goers mocked the long-time residents and
                        se&ntilde;oras demanding that affluent gallerists and collectors leave their community. The community&rsquo;s
                        presence clearly upset the privileged crowd, proving their self-imposed alienation from the neighborhood and its
                        needs.</span></p>
